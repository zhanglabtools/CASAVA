Some code and resources of the paper 'Disease Category-specific Annotation of Non-coding Variants Using an Ensemble Learning Framework'.

You could follow the R script in the CASAVA_toolkit folder to get the CASAVA scores for large amounts of genetic variants.
Whole-genome CASAVA scores can directly be downloaded from the release part on Github https://github.com/zhanglabtools/CASAVA/releases.

The following four script may be helpful in reproducing the results:
CASAVA_library.R contains the commonly used functions of this study. (Attention: XGBoost V0.82 is used in this implementation.)
train_CASAVA_script.R is the script used to train CASAVA models.
train_TrCASAVA_script.R is the script used to train disease-specific and TrCASAVA models.
train_Zeroshot_script.R is the script used to train CASAVA models in the scenario of no disease-specific training data available.

We also uploaded the variants, training-testing sets, and trained models for checking and reproducing the results on Baidu Cloud Disk.
The ReadMe.docx would help you using these data.
